📄 Title: Development Team Project: Risk Identification Report
👤 Author: Ahmad Alsalami
🗓️ Submission: 8 September 2025
Overview

This branch focuses on the group-based risk identification project carried out in Unit 6. The objective was to collaboratively analyse a given scenario (Pampered Pets) and identify key security vulnerabilities using risk management principles. This involved working with team members to create a detailed risk register, applying both qualitative and quantitative assessments of threats, and recommending controls aligned with best practice frameworks.

Key Contributions by Ahmad Alsalami
✅ Risk Categorisation and Matrix

I was responsible for identifying external risks, such as third-party software vulnerabilities and insecure API integrations. Using ISO/IEC 27005 standards, I classified these risks by likelihood and impact and helped populate the risk matrix. I also participated in discussions to agree on scoring logic for residual risks.

✅ Control Recommendations

I proposed mitigation strategies for risks including:

Enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Encrypting data in transit and at rest

Performing regular third-party audits
These were supported by referencing ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A controls and the NIST CSF.

✅ Report Writing and Formatting

I contributed to drafting sections of the report, particularly:

“Identified Threats”

“Risk Register Table”

“Conclusion and Recommendations”

I ensured our output met academic standards, included in-text citations, and followed the Harvard referencing style.

Collaboration Tools and Experience

Microsoft Teams: Used for regular team meetings and document sharing.

Google Docs: Co-editing the live document with tracked changes.

WhatsApp: Daily updates and coordination with team members.

I experienced some coordination challenges early on due to differing time zones and unclear task allocations. However, by mid-week, I proposed a task board that helped us structure our contributions using a RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed).
