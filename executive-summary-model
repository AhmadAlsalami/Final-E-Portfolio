📌 Title: Final Individual Project – Executive Summary
👤 Author: Ahmad Alsalami
🗓️ Submission: 13 October 2025
🗂️ Component: Individual Project (Unit 11)
📘 Overview

This branch contains the executive summary of my final individual project for the SRM_PCOM7E module. The task required me to identify and evaluate supply chain risks and propose a disaster recovery (DR) strategy and GDPR-compliant response plan for a fictional e-commerce SME. The goal was to ensure business continuity and regulatory compliance while minimising operational downtime.

🧠 What I Did
🔍 Risk Modelling and Identification

I utilised quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the top five risks facing the SME. These included:

Phishing attacks

Ransomware incidents

Cloud service outages (AWS-based)

Third-party data breaches

Weak access controls

Each risk was rated using a likelihood-impact matrix (based on ISO 31000 and NIST SP 800-30). The methodology was documented clearly in the executive summary.

🛡️ Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy

I proposed a 1-minute RTO/RPO recovery requirement for critical systems, using:

AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery

Multi-region backup replication

DR drills and tabletop exercises

🔐 GDPR Compliance

Included a 12-hour breach notification protocol and outlined:

Data minimisation

Encryption

Role-based access controls

Data Subject Access Rights (DSAR) handling procedures

This ensured the SME would avoid fines and remain compliant with Article 32 of the GDPR.

💡 Reflections and Takeaways

Completing this project strengthened my understanding of:

How to apply DR strategies in real-world SME contexts

The intersection of cybersecurity and data protection law

Designing realistic, cost-effective mitigation plans
It also enhanced my academic writing and report structuring skills for professional presentations.
